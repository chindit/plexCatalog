# PlexCatalog

This is a small utility tool to generate a PDF catalog
from a Plex server.

It's very rudimentary, but does the job.

# Usage
Be sure to have your Plex URL and port accessible and
get your token.

If you are not sure how to find your Plex Token, just
[have a look here](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)

# Online version
An online version can be found here: https://plex.chindit.be

It's running «as it» and generation can take some time.

# Support/Features
For the moment it's… really basic.

If you need a specific feature or want to support this project,
feel free to open an issue or to contact me.

Anyways, thanks for your support.
